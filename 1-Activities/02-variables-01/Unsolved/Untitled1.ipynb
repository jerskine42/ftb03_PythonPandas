    "# More Practice with Variables and Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will get more practice declaring and manipulating variables, as well as using if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the [starter file](Unsolved/condition-control-flow-02.py) and perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Character One**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `c1_name` and have it equal a string of \"Mr. Farley\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a variable called `c1_age` and have it equal to an integer of 65.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a variable called `c1_profession` and have it equal to \"Web Developer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a variable called `c1_salary` and have it equal to 100000.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a variable called `c1_species` and have it equal to \"cat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a variable called `c1_location` and have it equal to \"San Francisco, CA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create a variable called `c1_monthly_rent` and have it equal to 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create a variable called `c1_monthly_expenses` and have it equal to 1500.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Create a variable called `c1_yearly_rent` and have it equal to `c1_monthly_rent` * 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Create a variable called `c1_yearly_expenses` and have it equal to 1500.00 * 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Create a variable called `c1_savings` and have it equal to `c1_salary` - (`c1_yearly_rent` + `c1_yearly_expenses`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Character Two**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `c2_name` and have it equal a string of \"Mr. Snuggles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a variable called `c2_age` and have it equal to an integer of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a variable called `c2_species` and have it equal to \"mouse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a variable called `c2_profession` and have it equal to \"Accountant\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conditionals**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_name` is equal to \"Mr. Farley\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If so, print a string of \"Hello Mr. Farley\" using the `c1_name` variable.\n",

    "    * If not, print a string of \"Hello stranger\".\n",

    "    * If so, print a string of \"Mr. Farley comes from the home of the Raiders!\".\n",

    "\n",
    "    * Else, both conditions must not apply, therefore, print a string of \"Mr. Farley doesn't hail from a sports town.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_rent` is greater than `c2_rent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If so, print a string of \"Mr. Farley pays more rent than Mr. Snuggles\".\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_monthly_expenses` is greater than `c2_monthly_expenses`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If so, print a string of \"Mr. Farley has more expenses than Mr. Snuggles\".\n",

    "    * Else, `c1_monthly_expenses` must be equal to `c2_monthly_expenses`, therefore, print a string of \"Mr. Farley pays the same expenses as Mr. Snuggles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_profession` is equal to \"Web Developer\" AND if `c2_profession` is equal to \"Accountant\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If so, print a string of \"They are a Web Developer and an Accountant\".\n",
    "\n",
