# Getting Familiar with the Terminal

In this activity, you'll get more practice with terminal commands.

## Instructions

1. Open the terminal in this folder.

2. Use the `ls` command to see the contents of this folder.
## ls

3. Use the `pwd` command to find the current path you're in.
## pwd

4. Create a new directory named `Activity-1`. Then list the contents of the current directory again, to make sure it worked.
## mkdir Activity-1

5. Navigate into the directory you just created.
## cd act <tab>

6. Create a new file named `hello.md`. List the contents of the current directory again.
## touch hello.md

7. Copy the file you just made to a file named `world.md`.
## touch world.md

8. Rename the `hello.md` file to `coding.md`.
## mv hello.md coding.md

9. Create a new directory named `terminal`.
## mkdir terminal

10. Move the `world.md` file into the `terminal` folder you just made.
## mv world.md terminal/

11. Delete the `terminal` folder.
## rm -r terminal/

Use the Terminal Cheatsheet if you need guidance on which terminal commands should be used for each step.
